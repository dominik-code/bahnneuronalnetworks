# This project is subject to change

* Main goal is to have 3 independent nn to predict train data based on inputs.
* Everything will be loaded and saved to a database so we can scale the training process via multiple hosts later.
* Some other projects are used to save some work, see their code comments or readme for more detail about them.
* **Warning:** Nothing is currently tested and there are bugs for sure
